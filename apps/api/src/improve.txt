Goal:

remember our key goal, nobody who uses our platform goes away with a suboptimal gadget choice..we have to do everything to provide him all context equivalent to a techie doing research by redaging reviews specs user feedback and combiing with explicit knowledge about spoecs generations tech to make an informed choicce

Let's also fix this list and ensure its ready for both local execution as well as v0:

Canonicalize schema: Use the “laptops stack” (laptops, laptop_reviews, laptop_market_data) as the product source; keep gadgets only via a compatibility view for current UI.
Align dynamic AI tables: Pick ONE set and delete/merge duplicates. Keep anon‑friendly (public.user_profiles, conversation_sessions, conversation_turns, ui_configurations, user_interactions) or migrate service to “production-ready” names. Avoid both sets enabled at once.
Fix recommendations endpoint mismatch: Update POST /api/ai/recommendations to call the service correctly or add a wrapper method that accepts (userId, preferences, context) (apps/api/src/routes/dynamic-ai.ts:199).
Regenerate Supabase types: Include user_profiles, conversation_*, ui_configurations/adaptive_ui_configs, dynamic_recommendations, laptops/*, crawl_jobs, crawl_items in apps/api/src/types/database.ts:1.
Remove/replace RPC dependencies for dev: Guard or implement match_embeddings (apps/api/src/db/supabaseClient.ts:434) and stop using exec_sql in the script (scripts/apply-dynamic-ai-tables.js:31) — rely on migrations instead.
Seed baseline data: Add seed rows for tenants (slug default), tenant_api_keys, a few laptops, one laptop_market_data per laptop, and laptop_reviews in supabase/seed.sql.
Make API base configurable in web: Replace hardcoded http://localhost:3002 with process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL in web calls (e.g., apps/web/components/AdaptiveChat.tsx:38, :77).
Add OpenAI safe mode: If OPENAI_API_KEY missing, short‑circuit to fallbacks in DynamicAI service to avoid local failures (apps/api/src/services/dynamicAI.ts:1).
Validate security hardening references: Ensure all tables referenced by policies actually exist or remove the policy lines (supabase/migrations/20250906_security_hardening.sql:6).
Sanitize secrets: Remove real keys from apps/api/.env and keep only .env.example; use local .env ignored by git.
V0 Deployment

Single API surface: Choose Express API as serverless on Vercel (current code supports process.env.VERCEL === '1' export) and remove duplicate Next.js API routes for the same data, or proxy them to Express.
Vercel routing: Ensure vercel.json maps /api/* to the Express serverless function and apps/web deploys as the Edge site.
Set environment on Vercel: SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (serverless function only), OPENAI_API_KEY, SENTRY_DSN, NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*.
CORS and rate limiting: Include Vercel domains in allowed origins and confirm rate limits fit serverless (apps/api/src/index.ts:38).
Cache headers: Keep strong CDN headers on reads (already present in web Edge route); add similar headers to product reads on Express if exposed.
Indexes for prod: Confirm ivfflat, text, and join indexes exist for hot paths (brand/model, price, text search, embeddings) in migrations.
Observability: Enable Sentry DSN, structured logs, and add a minimal dashboard view for crawl health/access audit if using security audit log.

OTHER ENHNACEMENTS:

Data & Coverage

Multi‑source ingestion: retailer listings, OEM specs, expert sites, Reddit/YouTube, benchmark sources; enforce dedup by brand+model+variant.
Normalization: canonical spec dictionary (CPU/GPU gen, cores, TDP, panel, ports), unit coercion, generation tagging, upgradeability flags.
Review intelligence: credibility scoring, verified purchase flags, per‑aspect sentiment (performance, thermals, battery, build, value).
Benchmark unification: map disparate tests to normalized categories with higher‑is‑better flags and device config metadata.
Ranking & Guardrails

Multi‑objective ranker: relevance, value, performance, thermals/noise, battery, portability, reliability; weight by user priorities.
Hard constraints: absolute blockers (screen size range, budget ceiling, OS requirements, RAM upgradability).
Coverage checks: ensure at least one “safe pick”, one “performance pick”, one “value pick” per user; never return empty — offer trade‑offs.
Bias control: cap brand dominance, penalize known issues from review signals; explain trade‑offs explicitly.
Explanation & Evidence

Evidence‑backed reasoning: show why (“because…”) with citations to reviews/benchmarks/specs; expose confidence score.
Comparison mode: side‑by‑side table of top 3 with highlighted deltas on user‑important attributes.
Risk callouts: “Common issues” from sentiment mining (coil whine, heat, screen bleed); mitigation notes.
Freshness indicators: price history sparkline, stock status, last scrape timestamp, gen recency.
Adaptive UX

Expertise scaling: beginner (plain‑English, simple pros/cons), intermediate (key specs + light benchmarks), expert (full specs, test configs, thermal/power curves if available).
Smart filters: prefilled based on inferred use cases; show why each filter matters for the user intent.
What‑if prompts: budget +/- 10%, screen size swap, step‑up/step‑down options with expected deltas.
Feedback loop: “Helpful?” and “Missed requirement?” buttons tune weights and constraints immediately.
Freshness & Trust

Price/stock tracking: retailer heartbeat (cron), alert for price drops, duplicate retailer de‑spam.
Data quality score: per product, surface warnings for low evidence or unverified specs; prefer verified sources.
Reproducibility: show model version, features used, and data sources used for each recommendation.
Observability & Safety

Coverage dashboards: source freshness, scrape errors, gaps by brand/segment, model drift on satisfaction rate.
SLA: fallback recommendations when upstream AI/RPCs fail; graceful degradation to deterministic rules.
Ethics: disclose affiliate links, avoid dark patterns; never hide better options due to affiliate availability.
